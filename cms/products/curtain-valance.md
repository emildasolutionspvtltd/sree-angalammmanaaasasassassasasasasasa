  Valances are made from a variety of fabrics such as cotton, polyester, silk,
  or velvet. These materials are selected for their ability to drape well and
  complement the existing curtains or room dÃ©cor.
f_subtext-2: ' Available in multiple styles including swag, box pleat, or balloon, curtain valances can be ornate with patterns and trims or simple and sleek. They serve both aesthetic and functional purposes by adding dimension and a polished look to window treatments.'
f_subtext-3: >-
  Valances can be designed to fit various window sizes and are relatively easy
  to install, often using rods or tracks. They help cover up hardware and can
  adjust the visual proportions of windows, making them appear larger or more
  elaborately framed.
